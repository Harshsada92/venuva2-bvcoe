          >Vénuva will teach the way to empower yourself and influence others.
          Vénuva is inspiring and that it inspires students to be their own and
          wear whatever they want. It incites them to unravel their true
          potential and enhance their personality. We believe that our theme
          'Ace It With Style' is significant to students because it shows the
          world who they are or how they have worked upon themselves. Teenagers
          have different personalities, so there are clothes in different
          styles, sizes, colors, and materials. As people grow up, their sense
          of themselves is shaped by the clothes they wear. We at Vénuva have a
          principle of adapting our members and the students with us to the
          latest trends and bend them to the corporate style. Also the
          environment of Bharti Vidyapeeth strikes the right chord for learning
          and overall development of the students. The wide range of activities
          and events By Vénuva will provide students the much wanted break while
          ensuring their all round development. Being part of the society is a
          great way for all the students to meet other students who share the
          same interest in fashion and boost their confidence and sense of
          style. This society trains its members in having nuanced understanding
          qualities such as poise, panache and vivacity.
